# K-Means Clustering Project

This project uses Python and scikit-learn to perform K-Means clustering on synthetic data and visualize the clusters.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the script
python kmeans.py

This will generate and display a scatter plot showing the clustered data.


# K-Means Clustering with CSV Input

This Python script performs K-Means clustering using data from a CSV file.  
Users can input their own 2D data and visualize how the algorithm groups similar points.

## How to Use

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the script 
python kmeans_csv.py
